# Freelacing App

It is a freelance application is a comprehensive project whose front-end I did with React and Tailwind and its back-end was done with node.js by [@Saheb Mohamadi](https://github.com/sahebmohammadi) and has three roles: Admin, Freelancer and Owner.
The database management of this project is done with MongoDB and its API tools are taken from postman. React-Query is used for data fetch and React-hook-form is used for form validation, and the possibility of searching and sorting projects is also provided.

Other features of this project include the following options:
‚úÖ Ability to login with a mobile number along with an OTP code
‚úÖ User access level control process based on user role to pages using protected route
‚úÖ Authentication session management using refresh token and access token
‚úÖ Has two light and dark modes
‚úÖ Responsiveness of the project based on the user's screen size in mobile view and desktop view

‚òÄÔ∏è Note: for use demo and look at the whole of features of project after logging in and defining their role, if they have defined their role as an employer, they should click the project registration option, and if they have defined their role as a freelancer, they should click the project search option. Since the application is designed in such a way that each user's identity requires admin approval, I can confirm their user by a message in direct in https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahar-fallahi/.
